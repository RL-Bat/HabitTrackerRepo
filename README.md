Habit Tracker

Client Side: How it works,

This app was created with intent to allow users to track their day to day habits in order to promote a more healthier lifestyle. Simply sign into the application with your Google email, click the ‘Add Habit’ button, and fill out the information via the provided pop-up window. If a specific card needs to be deleted, use the delete card button. Each habit card can be manipulated via the Yes/no buttons. 'Yes' will increase the progress of your goal by 1 day, and 'No' will reset the progress back to zero.
